Digit Recognizer App

A Deep learning model which classifies digits drawn on a mobile application using Convolutional Neural Networks thorugh Keras, Tensorflow
2 ways you can use this App:
- Draw a digit on the drawing pad widget built using custom painter
- Upload an image to the app from your local mobile storage

The test set accuracy for the Deep learning model is about 99.3% 
Trying for a better accuracy using better augmentation techniques is possible but is unnecessary for this application.
Converted model to a tflite model to run on a mobile application.


You can check out some images of the project in predictions.md file.
The app itself is built using Dart, Flutter and Android studio.

Imporvements:
- Try more mobile suited augmentation
- Try to improve predictions on Drawing widget 
- Try to detect multiple digits 
- Trying to make more imporved app by recognizing other symbols like operators and operations
Note - Could'nt deploy the app in playstore because I could'nt afford the first time App developer registration fee by Google
Will deploy the latest version of the app ASAP
